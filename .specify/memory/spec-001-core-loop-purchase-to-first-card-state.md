# Specification 001: Core Loop — Purchase to First Card State

**Phase:** 1 — Specify
**Governing Document:** constitution.md v1.0
**Status:** Draft v1.1
**Last Amended:** 2026-09-24

> This Spec defines the thinnest complete vertical slice of the product: a user purchases a program, logs one workout, and sees both the dashboard and the gamified card reflect that real data — including the first trophy unlock. It deliberately excludes depth in any single subsystem in favor of proving the full loop connects correctly, per the Constitution's lean-scope principle (Article VIII.1).

---

## 1. Feature Summary

A user browses the catalog, purchases a single training program (the 24-week macro-cycle program used as the proof-of-concept), logs their first complete workout (warm-up + main lifts + cool-down), and immediately sees:
1. Their dashboard update with one real tonnage data point.
2. A chronological metric view containing tonnage, one point for every logged exercise, and any anthropometric measurements recorded during the program.
3. Their gamified Program Card transition from a fully locked state to a state showing real (if sparse) stats and the first unlocked trophy.

## 2. Reference Program (Proof of Concept)

- **Structure:** 24-week macro-cycle, divided into 3 mesocycles.
- **Workout unit:** Every individual workout session consists of a warm-up, main lifts, and a cool-down, logged together as a single unit — not as separate loggable events.
- This Spec does not require all 24 weeks of content to exist; only enough structured data (at minimum, Workout #1 of Mesocycle 1) to prove the loop end-to-end.

## 3. User Stories

**US-1.** As a prospective user, I want to purchase the program with a real payment, so that I gain access to its content immediately.

**US-2.** As an enrolled user, I want to log my first workout (warm-up, main lifts, cool-down as one session), so that my effort is recorded.

**US-3.** As an enrolled user, I want to see my dashboard reflect that logged workout via a tonnage data point, so that I have immediate feedback that my data was captured.

**US-4.** As an enrolled user, I want my Program Card to visibly change — from locked to unlocked — after completing my first workout, so that I feel a sense of accomplishment and progress.

**US-5.** As an enrolled user, I want to see my Program Card display real stats, a real (if minimal) graph, and a photo slot, even with only one workout logged, so that the card feels alive rather than a placeholder.

**US-6.** As an enrolled user, I want each exercise and body measurement tracked as its own chronological series, so that I can compare physical progress with performance over the program.

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Purchase
- FR-1: System MUST process payment via Stripe for a single program SKU.
- FR-2: On successful payment, system MUST create a User–Program enrollment record granting immediate, lifetime access (no expiration logic in this Spec).
- FR-3: On payment failure, user MUST NOT gain access, and MUST see a clear error state (exact copy deferred to Plan phase).

### 4.2 Workout Logging
- FR-4: System MUST present Workout #1 (warm-up + main lifts + cool-down) as a single loggable unit once enrolled.
- FR-5: User MUST be able to record, at minimum, weight and reps for each main-lift exercise in the workout.
- FR-6: Any set/exercise field left unrecorded at the point the workout is marked complete MUST be saved as zero, not null (per Constitution Article II.3).
- FR-7: On marking the workout complete, system MUST calculate tonnage for that session (tonnage = Σ(weight × reps) across all logged sets in that workout).
- FR-8: The completion trigger MUST fire at the "real-time" points defined in Constitution Article II.3: immediately on explicit completion, or automatically at next-calendar-day rollover if not explicitly closed out.

### 4.3 Dashboard
- FR-9: Dashboard MUST display a graph containing at least one plotted data point: the tonnage value from Workout #1.
- FR-10: The graph MUST be structured to accept additional data points in future workouts without redesign (i.e., time-series by workout, not a single static number).
- FR-11: Dashboard metric data MUST support separate chronological series for session tonnage, every logged exercise, and each recorded anthropometric measurement.
- FR-11a: Each metric point MUST include a stable metric identifier, display label, numeric value, unit, recorded timestamp, and source session.
- FR-11b: The system MUST NOT combine incompatible units in one series; unit conversion or separate unit-specific series is required before comparison.

### 4.4 Gamified Program Card
- FR-12: Program tiles MUST NOT display trophy status; trophy collection state belongs to a separate Trophy Garage.
- FR-13: The Trophy Garage MUST list earned trophies with their name, description, category, and unlock date.
- FR-14: Immediately upon Workout #1 completion (same trigger as FR-8), the Trophy Garage MUST include a "First Workout Complete" trophy.
- FR-14a: The trophy system MUST support unlock rules based on workout completion, measurements, consistency, and program exploration without changing program tile UI.
- FR-15: The dashboard MUST render real metric series rather than placeholder/mock data once workouts or measurements are logged.
- FR-16: The card MUST include a photo slot capable of displaying one user-uploaded image, even if only a single placeholder/"before" photo has been uploaded (full pre/post comparison logic is out of scope — see Section 6).

### 4.5 Data Integrity
- FR-17: All entities in this Spec (User, Program, Enrollment, Workout, WorkoutLog, Trophy, CardState) MUST persist in a manner that supports the Constitution's privacy standard (Article VI): encrypted at rest/in transit, private-by-default photo storage.

## 5. Key Data Entities (Conceptual — not final schema)

| Entity | Purpose | Key Fields (non-exhaustive) |
|---|---|---|
| `Program` | The purchasable product | id, name, macro_cycle_weeks, mesocycle_count, strength_formula_ref |
| `Workout` | A single program-defined session template | id, program_id, sequence_index, warmup_block, main_lift_block, cooldown_block |
| `Enrollment` | Links a user to a purchased program | id, user_id, program_id, purchased_at, access_type (lifetime, v1) |
| `WorkoutLog` | A user's completed instance of a Workout | id, enrollment_id, workout_id, completed_at, sets[], tonnage_total |
| `MetricDefinition` | Defines a graphable exercise or user measurement | id, label, category, unit, source_type |
| `MetricObservation` | A dated value for one graphable metric | id, metric_id, workout_log_id, recorded_at, value, unit |
| `Trophy` | A definable unlockable artifact | id, program_id, trigger_condition, asset_ref |
| `CardState` | Current render state of a user's program card | id, enrollment_id, latest_photo_ref |
| `TrophyUnlock` | A trophy earned through a defined rule | id, user_id, trophy_id, unlocked_at, trigger_source |

## 6. Explicitly Out of Scope (Deferred to Later Specs)

- Multiple concurrent program enrollments
- Advanced trophy rules beyond the initial workout, measurement, consistency, and exploration rules
- Full pre/post photo comparison logic (manual vs. automatic pairing)
- Time-boxed or subscription-based program access
- Refund handling and abandoned-program states
- Affiliate commission tracking and celebrity/influencer licensing metadata (Constitution Article IV) — not exercised in this Spec since the proof-of-concept program has no third-party licensing attached
- Streaks and secondary metrics not required to validate the core loop
- Offline logging support

## 7. Acceptance Criteria (Definition of Done for Spec 1)

- [ ] A test user can complete a real (or test-mode) Stripe purchase and immediately access the program.
- [ ] A test user can log Workout #1 in full (warm-up + main lifts + cool-down) with at least one main-lift set recorded.
- [ ] Tonnage is correctly calculated and stored for that session.
- [ ] The dashboard graph renders with exactly one real data point matching the logged tonnage.
- [ ] Every logged exercise produces its own performance metric point tied to the completed session.
- [ ] Any recorded anthropometric measurement produces a chronological metric point with its unit.
- [ ] Missing optional anthropometric measurements do not create false zero-valued points.
- [ ] Program tiles contain no trophy status text.
- [ ] The Trophy Garage renders the "First Workout Complete" trophy immediately after workout completion (or next-day rollover, per FR-8).
- [ ] Uploading one photo populates the card's photo slot correctly.
- [ ] No unrecorded set fields result in null values in the database (all default to zero).

## 8. Open Questions Carried Into Plan Phase

- Exact visual/UX definition of "locked" vs. "unlocked" trophy states (art direction, not a Spec-phase concern).
- Exact copy/UX for payment failure states.
- Whether tonnage should be shown as a raw number, formatted (e.g., "12,450 lbs lifted"), or paired with a comparative/motivational label — flagged per your note that tonnage's large magnitude is intentionally being used for user motivation ("ego stroke"), which should inform Plan-phase UX copy decisions.
